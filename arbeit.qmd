# Abstract {.unnumbered}

This paper examines how different types of non-voters in Switzerland can be classified and to which degree this classification models can predict whether someone votes or does not vote. 

# Introduction

Elections are a cornerstone of democratic legitimacy

# Literature Review: Typologies and Theoretical Approaches to Electoral Abstention in Switzerland

Political non-voting is a central theme in research on Swiss democracy. therefore several studies have aimed to typologize the heterogeneous group of non-voters and explain their behavior using theoretical models.

## Classical Approaches to Political Participation

Earlier studies explaining voter turnout were largely grounded in the **socio-structural** (e.g., Lazarsfeld), **social-psychological** (Campbell et al.), and **rational choice** (Downs) approaches. These frameworks were later enriched by participation research, especially the **Standard Model of Political Participation** (Barnes & Kaase, 1979), emphasizing socioeconomic resources and cognitive mobilization [@vatter_pdf_2003].

An conceptual was introduced by the **Civic Voluntarism Model** [@fatke_wollen_2015], which identifies **resources**, **motivation**, and **social networks** as important factors for political participation. This framework has proven particularly fruitful for empirically identifying different types of non-voters.

## Milbrath’s Hierarchical Model of Participation

Milbrath’s framework [@ruedin_testing_2007] conceptualizes participation as a **cumulative hierarchy** — from passive disengagement to elite political engagement. It integrates both **personal characteristics** and **external stimuli**, using the metaphor of a “ladder of political involvement.” Ruedin's simulation study validates this model and demonstrates the importance of both institutional contexts and interpersonal communication in fostering participation.

## A Swiss Typology: Bühlmann et al. (2003)

[@vatter_pdf_2003] developed a typology of Swiss non-voters based on cluster analysis of the 1999 federal elections. They identified six types:

- Politically Disinterested  
- Politically Disenchanted  
- Socially Isolated  
- Politically Incompetent  
- Protest Voters  
- Alternative Participants  

These types were derived from factor-analytic dimensions: political interest, competence, system trust, and socioeconomic status.

## Extension and Replication: Fatke & Freitag (2015)

Building on this, [@fatke_wollen_2015] used data from the 2011 Swiss federal elections and applied the same Civic Voluntarism lens. They identified six similar but updated types of non-voters — including *satisfied but disengaged*, *incompetent*, and *abstaining but participatory*. Their findings underline that abstention is **not** a monolithic phenomenon, but results from complex, varied reasons.

## Democratic Implications and Empirical Consensus

Across all studies, a consistent insight emerges: **non-voters are not a homogeneous group**. The most problematic from a democratic perspective are the *socially isolated* and *incompetent*, who lack both resources and supportive environments [@fatke_nichtwahlenden_2015].

However, not all abstention indicates apathy or disaffection. Some groups — such as the *alternative participants* or the *satisfied disengaged* — opt out of elections because they are either politically content or prefer other forms of participation (e.g., initiatives, protests) [@fatke_nichtwahlenden_2015].

Low turnout, therefore, should not be automatically interpreted as a crisis of democracy — but as a signal of differentiated modes of political engagement.



# Theory

## Electoral Abstention as a Multi-Dimensional Phenomenon

Political non-voting has traditionally been viewed as a simple lack of civic engagement. However, contemporary research has demonstrated that non-voters are far from homogeneous: they vary widely in motivation, capabilities, social embeddedness, and attitudes towards politics. Typologies of non-voters have emerged as a more nuanced framework, arguing that abstention results from a variety of individual resource constellations, political orientations, and forms of societal integration [@vatter_pdf_2003; @fatke_wollen_2015].

## The Civic Voluntarism Model as Theoretical Foundation

This study relies on the **Civic Voluntarism Model** (CVM) by Verba, Schlozman, and Brady, which posits that political participation depends primarily on three factors:
1. **Resources** (e.g., time, money, civic skills)
2. **Motivation** (e.g., political interest, efficacy)
3. **Recruitment networks** (e.g., social integration, mobilization)

Non-voting can thus be interpreted as the result of lacking one or more of these factors, rather than simply a sign of disengagement or protest. The CVM offers a useful theoretical lens to differentiate types of abstention based on individual-level deficits in motivation, resources, or integration.

## Typologies of Non-Voters in Switzerland

Building on the CVM, Bühlmann, Freitag, and Vatter [@vatter_pdf_2003] introduced a detailed typology of Swiss non-voters, later refined by Fatke and Freitag [@fatke_wollen_2015]. Their empirical work identifies multiple types, such as:
- **Apathetic non-voters** (low interest, low competence, low integration)
- **Protest-oriented non-voters** (low system trust, high dissatisfaction)
- **Satisfied or alternative participants** (content with the system or engaged through other forms)
- **Socially isolated** (lack of networks)
- **Politically incompetent** (low education, low efficacy)

For the purpose of this study, these can be aggregated into three main theoretical groups, each rooted in a specific mechanism of abstention:

| Type                      | Main Mechanism                 | Theoretical Foundation        |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Apathetic**             | Lack of motivation/resources   | Civic Voluntarism Model      |
| **Protest-oriented**      | Political alienation           | System support/trust theory  |
| **Satisfied/Alternative** | Rational non-participation     | Expressive/instrumental participation |

## Focus on Persistent Non-Voters

This research specifically examines **persistent non-voters**—individuals who abstained in both the 2019 and 2023 Swiss federal elections. Compared to situational abstainers, persistent non-voters are more likely to display stable psychological, ideological, or structural characteristics. By classifying the types within this subgroup, the analysis seeks to provide a theoretically grounded explanation for enduring abstention.

## Theoretical Expectations and Hypotheses

Based on this typology, the following hypotheses are derived:

- **H1 (Political Interest & Knowledge):** Apathetic non-voters will report significantly lower political interest and political knowledge than other groups.
- **H2 (System Satisfaction & Trust):** Protest-oriented non-voters will express lower trust in political institutions and lower satisfaction with democracy than other groups.
- **H3 (Socioeconomic Status):** Apathetic non-voters will have lower levels of education and income, while satisfied/alternative non-voters will resemble voters in their socioeconomic status.
- **H4 (Social Integration):** Apathetic non-voters will display weaker social ties and fewer organizational memberships compared to other groups.
- **H5 (Party Identification & Ideological Self-Placement):** Protest-oriented non-voters will be politically positioned on the ideological spectrum but report weak or no party identification.

To empirically test these hypotheses, a multinomial logistic regression will be estimated, using **voters** as the reference category and the predictors derived from the theoretical framework.





# Empirical Analysis

## Data and Descriptive Statistics

We use data from the CSES dataset, focusing on economic evaluations, incumbent support, and controls. Descriptive statistics are summarized in @tbl-stats.

```{r}

```

## Methods

We estimate an OLS model and a logistic regression with interaction terms. The dependent variable is voting for the incumbent, and key predictors include economic evaluations and political information.

## Results

OLS results are shown in @tbl-reg.



Logistic regression results explore interaction effects, visualized in @fig-interaction.



# Discussion

The results confirm that negative economic perceptions reduce incumbent support. Politically informed voters show a stronger reaction, highlighting the moderating role of knowledge.

# Conclusion

This study supports economic voting theory, emphasizing political information as a critical moderator. Future research should explore additional factors influencing voting behavior.
